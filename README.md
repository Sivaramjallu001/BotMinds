# **BotMinds - AI-Powered Domain-Specific Chatbot**

BotMinds is an AI-powered chatbot built using advanced NLP techniques and LLMs (Large Language Models). The chatbot is designed to provide meaningful and context-aware conversations on a specific domain (e.g., customer support, programming, education). This project showcases the power of NLP and fine-tuning large language models for real-world applications.

## **Key Features**
- **Domain-Specific Conversations**: Customizable to handle specific topics like programming, customer support, or healthcare.
- **Fine-Tuned LLM**: Utilizes a pre-trained **GPT-2** model fine-tuned with domain-specific conversational data.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Maintains context throughout conversations to generate coherent responses.
- **Multilingual Support** (optional): Ability to handle multiple languages.
- **Real-time Interactions**: Chatbot capable of handling user queries with quick, real-time responses.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** (for backend and model development)
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (for model fine-tuning and handling NLP tasks)
- **Flask** or **FastAPI** (for backend API)
- **Streamlit** / **React** (for frontend chat interface)
- **OpenAI GPT-2** (or alternative large language model for training)
- **PyTorch** / **TensorFlow** (for model training)
- Optional: **MongoDB** (for storing conversation history)

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you'll need:
- Python 3.6+
- Node.js (if using React for frontend)
- Basic understanding of NLP and LLMs

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BotMinds.git
    cd BotMinds
    ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
    - Navigate to the backend directory and install the dependencies:
      ```bash
      cd backend
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3. **Frontend Setup** (if using React):
    - Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      npm install
      ```

4. **Training the Model** (If building your own model):
    - Download a pre-trained model (e.g., GPT-2) from Hugging Face:
      ```bash
      pip install transformers
      python train_model.py
      ```
    - Fine-tune the model with your domain-specific dataset.

5. **Run the Backend Server**:
    - For Flask:
      ```bash
      python app.py
      ```
    - For FastAPI:
      ```bash
      uvicorn main:app --reload
      ```

6. **Frontend Setup**:
    - Navigate to the frontend directory and run:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

7. **Access the Chatbot**:
    - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` (Flask) or `http://localhost:3000` (React-based frontend).

## **How It Works**
1. The user submits a query via the chatbot interface.
2. The query is sent to the backend, which processes the message using the fine-tuned LLM (GPT-2 or similar).
3. The model generates a response based on the query.
4. The response is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

## **Model Fine-Tuning**
- The chatbot uses **GPT-2**, a transformer-based model, which is fine-tuned on domain-specific conversational data.
- You can use your own dataset or public datasets like **Persona-Chat**, **Cornell Movie-Dialogs**, or any domain-specific data to fine-tune the model.

### **Training Steps**:
1. Preprocess your dataset into the appropriate format (text-based conversations).
2. Fine-tune the model using Hugging Face's `Trainer` API or PyTorch.
3. Save the model and load it in the backend API for inference.
