# BotMinds

BotMinds - AI-Powered Domain-Specific Chatbot
BotMinds is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide interactive, real-time answers to user queries. This chatbot leverages state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and generate meaningful conversations. You can deploy BotMinds in various domains, such as customer support, education, or healthcare.

Features
Domain-Specific Conversations: Customizable to handle specific topics like programming, customer support, or healthcare.
Natural Language Understanding: Powered by advanced NLP models (GPT or fine-tuned models).
Interactive User Interface: Easy-to-use web or mobile interface for seamless interaction.
Contextual Awareness: Maintains conversation flow and context for more meaningful interactions.
Multilingual Support: (Optional) Handle multiple languages with slight adjustments.
Technologies Used
OpenAI GPT (or other transformer models like GPT-2, GPT-J)
Flask / FastAPI (for backend server)
Streamlit / React (for frontend)
MongoDB / Firebase (optional for database)
Speech Recognition (Optional: Whisper or Google Speech-to-Text for voice input)
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you'll need:

Python 3.6+
Node.js (for frontend if using React)
MongoDB (optional, for storing user data)
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash

Edit
cd frontend
npm install
Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your OpenAI API key:
bash
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Run the Server:

For Flask:
bash
Copy

npm start
Access the Chatbot:

Open a browser and go to http://localhost:5000 (for Flask) or http://localhost:3000 (for React-based frontend).
How It Works
The user submits a query via the chatbot interface.
The query is sent to the backend, which uses OpenAI GPT (or another model) to generate a response.
The backend sends the response back to the frontend for display.
Customization
Change Domain: You can adjust the knowledge base or fine-tune the model for a specific domain.
Add More Features: Integrate with additional APIs (e.g., weather, stock prices) for dynamic responses.
Multilingual Support: Adjust the chatbot to respond in multiple languages by modifying the model and adding translation APIs.
